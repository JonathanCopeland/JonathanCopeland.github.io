<!-- ## Demo content -->

I was delighted that Kevin Kelly had me back on <a href="">Cool Tools </a> to nerd out on video about four of my favorite tools:
* my beloved brush pens
* my date stamps
* iOSâ€™s Live Text recognition
* my bicycle

If you enjoy this kind of thing, I dished about four other tools last year.
