Increasingly, I'm started to think of SwiftUI as a design tool that helps define no-missing-pieces design hand-off. Not all parts of a design are visible, and tools like Figma are great to displaying a particular state, dimension and data set, however these will always have their limits. No matter how diligent the designer behind them, during implementation there will be a fair amount of reading between the lines that engineers will need to do to fully realise a design.
