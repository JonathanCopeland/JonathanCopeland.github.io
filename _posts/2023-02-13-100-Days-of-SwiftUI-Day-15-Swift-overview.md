I've enjoyed how lightweight Swift *feels* in comparison to other languages like C++ or Java. I've noticed this in it's concise and readable syntax, as well as it's helpful compiler which gives clear feedback as to where to debug your code.

For future reference I've made a Swift overview document that can be found [here](https://github.com/JonathanCopeland/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/Swift/Overview.playground/Contents.swift). 

Day 15 of the course includes this great [Learn essential Swift in one hour](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/242/learn-essential-swift-in-one-hour) video which demos various features.
