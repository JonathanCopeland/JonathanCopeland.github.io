Today, I'm proud to share that _I've completed the [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)_ challenge. Repository [here](https://github.com/JonathanCopeland/100DaysOfSwiftUI).

It's been rewarding and growing, especially whilst navigating peak periods at work. It's a good day for dreaming - here's to what's next.
