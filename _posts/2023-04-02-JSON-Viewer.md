Today I discovered, [JSON Viewer](https://jsonviewer.app), a 'native Mac app to visualise, validate and format JSON datasets in a clean and snappy interface'.

In my test case I opened a 4 MB JSON file containing 97,296 lines of data and it loaded quickly with syntax highlighting and the ability to easily expand and collapse nodes.
