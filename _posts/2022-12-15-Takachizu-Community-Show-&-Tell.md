Lately, I've found joy in rediscovering the web. One of my favourite finds has been [takachizu.org](http://takachizu.org), a community archive for Little Tokyo, Los Angeles. 

The site uses bold colours, typography and layout to surface everyday "gathered treasures" from across the community - it even includes downloadable Zines.

> "The Japanese words Takara (“Treasure”) and Chizu (“Map”) join to form “Takachizu” (“treasure map”). Takachizu is a community “show & tell” gathering space designed to identify and reflect on that which is most valuable, celebrated, and in need of protection in Little Tokyo." - Takachizu, about page
