Today I started [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com). 

The course starts with the fundamentals of Swift then moves onto SwiftUI from Day 16, so I'm looking forward to that. I intend to use this website to document my learnings and share useful resources that I find on the way.
