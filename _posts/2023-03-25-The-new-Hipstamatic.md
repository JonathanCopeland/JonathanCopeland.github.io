The new [Hipstamatic](http://hipstamatic.com/x/) is one of the best of examples of quality iOS design in 2023. 

It's full of moments of delight and craft, with tasteful animations throughout. 

Also, leveraging [App Clips](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/) on the web as a sub-step between web pages and the App Store feels right. Users get a chance to get a feel for your app without getting redirected and having to go through the whole process of entering their Apple ID and starting a download. Try it [here](https://hipstamatic.app/hello).
