So many nice details in the Airbnb 2023 Summer Release. The playful animation used for onScroll and onTap for the Host Passport is delightful.

It's interesting to increasingly see the return of skeuomorphic design in releases from the past year or so. Arc browser mobile, Apple Books, Hipstamatic (2023), Halide, Flighty, (Not Boring) apps are a few great examples that come to mind.
