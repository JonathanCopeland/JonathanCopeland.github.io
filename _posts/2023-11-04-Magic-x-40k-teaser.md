Over the past the past month or so I've been combining my love of iOS and Magic the Gathering my building a Magic x 40k card viewer. What's great here is I've fully recreated the Magic card layout in SwiftUI, with the data drawing from a local JSON file. What I'm sharing today will serve as a teaser, with a breakdown coming later.
