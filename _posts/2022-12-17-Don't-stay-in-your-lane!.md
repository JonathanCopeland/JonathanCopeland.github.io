I've been re-listening to the [soundtrack](https://music.apple.com/ie/album/maniac-music-from-the-netflix-limited-series/1436990509) of the Netflix original series [Maniac](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L6cDDmk-O5A). The composer [Dan Romer](https://danromer.com) absolutely nailed the tone and spirit of the show, and I've been trying to learn more about him and his approach - which lead to me to listen to an interview he did on [Score: The Podcast S4E9](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cA46M0CnemU)

It's a great discussion, but this segment particularly stood out to me: 

> "I get the question fairly often, ‘I want to be a film composer, what do I do?’ The thing I always say is, just learn to be a musician. Learn to do every part of the music process. *Don’t look film scoring in the eye.*
> 
> I never intended to make film music. If you say that all you want to do is score films or video games or TV, those jobs aren’t everywhere - especially for aspiring composers. So you need to figure out your jobs. You might not become a film composer,... but you might become something else.
> 
> It is a lot better for your life, career and creativity to say, ‘I just want to make things. It's going to happen however it's going to happen, but I can’t control that so I am just going to do my best whenever I can.’"

I love where he advises not to look film scoring in the eye, but to simply "make things". This reminded me of a snippet from [Keep Going by Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing/):

> “Job titles can mess you up. Job titles, if they’re taken too seriously, will make you feel like you need to work in a way that befits the title, not the way that fits the actual work. 
> 
> Job titles can also restrict the kinds of work that you feel like you can do. If you only consider yourself a “painter,” then what happens when you want to try out writing? If you only consider yourself a “filmmaker,” what happens when you want to try sculpting?”

This thinking translates to product design where I see the best designers, PMs, and engineers borrow thinking and processes from other disciplines. The way to mastery is not staying in your lane!
